Strategies are a way to control the data you are generating, you are free to add as many as you want

### Unique

Make sure the data you generate is not duplicated with this strategy

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // 2
$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // Error too many tries
```

The unique strategy also gives the possibility to use a seed to have multiple unique generator:

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->unique('my-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
$faker->unique('my-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 2
$faker->unique('my-other-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
```
