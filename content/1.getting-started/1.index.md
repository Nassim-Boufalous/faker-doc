description: Welcome to Faker's enhanced PHP library. 
---

Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

This Faker package has been made to answer all previous Faker conception problems.
- Huge download size (More than 3MB)
- Not handling extension well (for open source packages)
- Can't use multiple generators (unique / regex)
- Architecture caveats

Check out the [documentation](/getting-started/usage) for more details on installation, usage, and all available features.


This version is built with developers in mind, offering a flexible solution that aligns with modern PHP standards.
